Note-taking Application for Introduction to iOS, Spring 2014
Developed in Xcode 4.6, and tested on iPhone Simulator 6.1.

This application allows users to:
- write and save text based notes on their iPhone
- write and edit the note's title and main text
- select a photo from their camera roll to attach to a note (which can be changed)
- view the photo 'full screen' (aspect fit instead of fill)
- see the time and date at which a note was created
- email a note (including it's title, text and image)
- delete notes

Please see the user guide for a quick overview of application use.

The organization of the application was developed from an empty template, but based on the master-detail template.
To supplement class material, I also used several online sources. These include:
- http://www.raywenderlich.com/1797/ios-tutorial-how-to-create-a-simple-iphone-app-part-1
- http://www.raywenderlich.com/1914/nscoding-tutorial-for-ios-how-to-save-your-app-data
- http://www.appcoda.com/ios-programming-101-send-email-iphone-app/
- http://www.appcoda.com/ios-programming-create-email-attachment/
- and many StackOverflow pages.

I chose to use NIBs over storyboards and programmatic methods because it felt like a happy medium between the two. 
I've really enjoyed this assignment and class and am excited for future iOS development :)
